# IBM Granite Community Project Management (pm)

This repo is used by members of the Granite Community to organize and track our efforts to build with and deploy Granite Code models in the world.

This is currently focused on our first priority: build out of the Granite Code Cookbook, which has recipes for building applications with Granite, including some example applications.
