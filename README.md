# IBM Granite Community Project Management (pm)

This repo describes the effort to build a community around and evangelize Granite Code models.

This is focused on build out of the Granite Code Cookbook, which has recipes for building applications with Granite, including some example applications.

### Out of Scope

The Granite Code Cookbok and any other Granite cookbooks will purposely NOT focus on build out and support for:

* Production scale up and devops.
* Security/cost optimization and production support for any recipe.
* Inclusion of customer-specific data/context/requirements.
