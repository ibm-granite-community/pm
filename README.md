# README for `granite-pm`

This repo is for getting organized internally to IBM. It includes project planning at the level of active and baclog issues. 

### Strategy

The [strategy was presented](https://ibm-my.sharepoint.com/:p:/p/adam_pingel/EWEB7shElyVLoc25ROwNSlQBD8_oP2jXnFvikQJymf68uA?e=JogUgs) on June 26th, 2024, and approved by Dario and leadership with the following additional requirements:
  
* We need "the right" OKRs, metrics, and targets.
* We need to define a proposed 30-60-90 day plan on getting up and running for developers any way we can without undue bias towards basing using only watsonx.ai services. Third-party model serving options should be considered and prioritized is that gets us up and running faster with developers.
* We will start with Granite code and Time Series.

### Granite Code Cookbooks: Community Product Requirements Document (CPRD)

This document describes the vision, high-level objectives, and derived requirements for the effort to build a community around and evangelize Granite Code models. This is focused on build out of the Granite Code Cookbook, which has recipes for building applications with Granite, including some example applications.

* [Draft](https://ibm-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/p/dean_wampler/EYeRyuKVbUVAlDSUxyoJB2EBUjI8Itvvp8va3BYKePDFcA?e=g89Xeu) (Sharepoint). 

> For reference, it is (loosely) based on [this Community Product Requirements Document (CPRD) template](https://ibm-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/p/dean_wampler/Eagmc-rBNqlGvLpyMklj7Y8BC-78rS4-noNVWaxNr7hGZA?e=qj4xWB) (Sharepoint) created for the AI Alliance.

### Out of Scope Today - Because of Business Model
The Granite Code Cookbok and any other Granite cookbooks will purposely NOT focus on build out and support for:

* Production scale up and devops.
* Security/cost optimization and production support for any recipe.
* Inclusion of customer-specific data/context/requirements.

These areas are left to be addressed and moneitzed by IBM and Redhat products and consulting.
